# Development Path 👣🚀📚
This is where I post notes on my studies, development progress, participation in trainings and courses, etc. Something like a blog, if I may call it like that.😉 Note📃: there aren't many events here yet, but I'll try to complete them soon.
 
 
 
#### 31.10.2024
Today I made some changes to the action/development plan👨‍💻
And in the end I turned it upside down🤣
Some changes in:
* the order of learning and gaining experience,
* spreading the material in time in a different way,
* added time for activities, rest and regeneration,
* AND working on my own mindset - that I think everybody needs.


to the never-ending adventure called DEVELOPMENT!😎👨‍🎓📈


#### 29.10.2024
Workshop of Kubernetes with Damian Naprawa - another great mini workshop where showed how to deploy an application, services or tools in Kubernetes and prepare well for it, as well as how to scale and monitor the deployed application. All on a live organism with practical examples which was really nice experience for me.



#### 25.10.2024
And I did! 🥳
OTWA officially finished 😁 The first report came out well, especially since it was my first in security testing. Here, experience from previous jobs in writing control protocols and paying attention to detail came in very handy.

Today, there was an event [Kongres DevSecOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03AoBi4bLQ0) all day long organized by [Bezpieczny Kod](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bezpiecznykod/).
Topics covered:
- Keynote: DevSecOps and career development in cybersecurity,
- 12 principles of secure architecture,
- Security management of open-source components,
- Effective Secret Management in Kubernetes: Strategies and Tools with CSI Drivers,
- The Dark Side of OSS,
- How to secure pipelines with DevSecOps in Azure DevOps (topic has been changed, but will be added later),

It was a very interesting event, with many practical examples. But it was not all. 

Later that day I also joined workshop called [Shakuj Kubernetesa](https://www.youtube.com/live/OGPYp9Nf-qI). Of course it was ethical hacking and most important in it was how to secure app better.
