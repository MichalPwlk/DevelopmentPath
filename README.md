# Development Path 👣🚀📚
This is where I post notes on my studies, development progress, participation in trainings and courses, etc. Something like a blog, if I may call it like that.😉

Note📃: there aren't many events here yet, but I'll try to complete them soon.

To take small steps forward I started the path of a Security Engineer on the THM platform:

Today, there was an event [Kongres DevSecOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03AoBi4bLQ0) all day long organized by [Bezpieczny Kod](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bezpiecznykod/).
Topics covered:
- Keynote: DevSecOps and career development in cybersecurity,
- 12 principles of secure architecture,
- Security management of open-source components,
- Effective Secret Management in Kubernetes: Strategies and Tools with CSI Drivers,
- The Dark Side of OSS,
- How to secure pipelines with DevSecOps in Azure DevOps (topic has been changed, but will be added later),
- Software, Security and the Butterfly Effect.
It was a very interesting event, with many practical examples. But it was not all. 

Later that day I also joined workshop called [Shakuj Kubernetesa](https://www.youtube.com/live/OGPYp9Nf-qI). Of course it was ethical hacking and most important in it was how to secure app better.
